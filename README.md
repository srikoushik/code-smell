# code-smell
The aim of this repository is to practise few clean code practise in Java.

First start with the file [Naming.java](https://github.com/srikoushik/code-smell/blob/master/src/amdocs/Naming.java)

Connection to next file will be metioned in the top of the current file.

# VariableNaming.java
When compared to previous file, here we would be changing the variable names. Eg: a, b, c, obj.

# Comment.java
In this step we would be removing all the comments, since we've self-explainable variables.

# Duplicate.java
Now we'll be moving all the ```System.out.println()``` to a common function.

# AlgorithmDuplication.java
Here we'll be moving the common logic of getting the input from the console to the common function.

# AddingConditions.java
Here we'll be increasing the complexity of the program by adding the condition for validating the input from the console.

# ConditionalDecompression.java
Here we'll extract the conditional logics to a method.

# LongMethod.java
Now we'll extract the conditional logic to a method. Also we'll be changing the nested ```if else``` to ```for``` loop.
